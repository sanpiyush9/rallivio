## KI-001 — Vercel expects "dist", Next.js outputs ".next"
First seen: 2026-09-15 · Status: Resolved · Ladder level: 3 → target 4
Severity: HIGH

### Symptom
Vercel completed the Next.js build and prerendering successfully, then failed with:
`Error: No Output Directory named "dist" found after the Build completed.`

### Cause
The Vercel project was configured to expect `dist`, while the Next.js application produces `.next`.

### Fix
Added repository-level `vercel.json` declaring the Next.js framework and `.next` output directory. This makes the known mismatch self-correcting at deployment configuration level.

### Prevention
Keep Vercel's framework/build settings aligned with the repository and verify deployments through CI. Level 3 is reached because the repository now auto-recovers this known configuration mismatch. Level 4 would require preventing dashboard drift entirely.

## KI-002 — ESLint crashes silently during build
First seen: 2026-09-15 · Status: Resolved · Ladder level: 2 → target 2
Severity: HIGH

### Symptom
The Next.js build compiled successfully, but reported:
`⨯ ESLint: nextVitals is not iterable`
while continuing through page generation.

### Cause
The initial flat ESLint configuration loaded `eslint-config-next` in a shape that did not match the expected flat-config iterable form.

### Fix
Use `FlatCompat` from `@eslint/eslintrc`, load `next/core-web-vitals` and `next/typescript`, keep `next` and `eslint-config-next` aligned at 15.5.24, and run standalone `npm run lint` in CI.

### Prevention
Keep `eslint-config-next` and `next` aligned, run lint independently, and fail CI on lint/configuration errors.

### Related
None yet.
